        <h1>Hostel Help</h1>
        <p>An all-in-one platform for everything you need</p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>Our project aims to make hostel management more digitally accessible and efficient. The vision is to solve many problems faced by the students.</p>
        <h2>Ideas behind the project</h2>
        <p>
            The plan is to create a website for the management of our hostel where we can have all the information about our hostel and every resource that students use in their daily life. We aim to provide students with everything they need.
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule a laundry service with door-to-door pick-up and drop-off of clothes</li>
            <li>Address maintenance-related issues like lights, fans, plugs, or any floor-related issues like lights in common areas, taps, or anything related to maintenance and ethernet issues. Users can fill out a form, and it will be addressed by the hostel office</li>
            <li>Booking of sports equipment in advance like table-tennis, football. It may seem impractical at the moment, but in the future, as our college grows and the number of students increases, it will be very helpful</li>
            <li>Booking a ride to the highway through E-Rickshaw (itâ€™s just a suggestion)</li>
            <li>A place where students can share reviews of anything (like a hackathon they attended or a place they went to eat in Nagpur)</li>
            <li>Details about all our clubs and their team portals, all the happening events, and other information like their team members and more</li>
            <li>Information about a student like their name, photo, room number, branch, and contact information (we can collect this information from the user during the login/registration process)</li>
            <li>We can add a mess section with relevant information like menu and special meal days (festivals)</li>
            <li>We can also digitalize the hostel leaving system. Students can fill out the hostel leaving form online, hopefully saving some paper</li>
            <li>We can have a lost and found section where students can list their lost items</li>
            <li>We can have a buy and sell section where students can list items they want to sell</li>
        </ul>
        We can give this website to our college hostel, and they can manage it accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2>Designer's Part</h2>
        <p>A good design is what makes the difference between a good website and an excellent one. We expect the following from anyone who is contributing to the design of our project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The design should be modern and should resonate with our college</li>
            <li>The design should be visually appealing to the user, and uniformity should be maintained throughout the website</li>
            <li>The design should be student-friendly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The expected design software is Figma.</p>
        <h2>Code Part</h2>
        <p>Please read the "Ideas behind the project" for a good understanding.</p>
        <p>
            We expect you to use the following technologies in our project:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend</li>
            <li>Node.js as the backend language</li>
            <li>MongoDB as our database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We intend to use the MERN stack for building this project.</p>
        </p>
